# Chess-JavaProject

this project was developed by professor NÃ©lio Alves. Here I am using it as part of the study of the Java language and to apply some knowledge such as:

    Encapsulation | Associations  | Access Modifiers | Enumeration  |
    Inheritance   | Static Menber | Overloading      | Polymorphism |
    Downcasting and Upcasting     |  Exceptions      | Abstract method / class  . . .
